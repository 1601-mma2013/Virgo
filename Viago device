+-    - vaigo device is the right tool to use to awake sleepy driver.
+1. Objectives
+   To create a Bluetooth headset to track driver drowsiness at the wheel.
  
+-7. Challenges
+-    - hard to make the driver to believe in this product since it new to the market and most driver such as a public transportation driver can’t afford or interested in buying this device.
+2. How
  
 +   - It monitors the wearer's eyes and head motion for signs of drowsiness and stimulates them when they are dozing off.
 +   - A real-time dashboard allows management to track this information in real-time.
 +   
 +   ### b. Audit

 -## 2. Modeling
 -### a. Personas 
 -Bus Driver
 +   In the past few years, many type of technology that are been use to alert people by not being sleepy while driving. Before this people usually drink a coffee or take anything that can prevent being sleepy while driving or working. But in this new era there are many technology that have been created to make people alert from being sleepy. There are some of the technology that have been created and most of the technology is slighly more simple and direct use by the user. Some of the user might have difficult time to use the technology without any feature so for any futher some research that have been collected based on people feels example in a boring lecture, cramming all night at the library, or working long hours at internships,Coffees and energy drinks were all somewhat effective in keeping people from dozing off, but the most reliable way to stay alert was having a buddy next to other that could watch others were losing people focus and nudge people when others started to doze off.

 +3. Relevant technologies
  
 +   - Bluetooth headset that monitors driver alertness at the wheel, by tracking eye and head motion. When it senses that the driver is drowsy, it can use a combination of audio alerts and vibrations to stimulate the driver and keep them safe at the wheel. Both individual drivers and professional drivers can use Vigo to stay safe at the wheel. For fleets, a real-time dashboard allows fleet managers to track this information and rearrange shifts and work schedules, to reduce the chances of a drowsiness-related accident.
  
 -Bio: 
 -    - Farid is owner of the bus company that hire people to work for him.
 +   - Tracks patterns in the wearer’s blinks and their body's movement to quantify how alert they are in real time. The idea is simple - although the brain has a tendency to trick someone into thinking they’re mentally fit enough to keep pushing on with daily business, the body can’t hide when it’s tired. With an infrared sensor, an accelerometer, and a clever algorithm.
  
 -1. Goals.
 -     - To run a bus company business and take profit on it.
 +     ​
  
 -2. Patterns.   
 -     - run business
 -     - pay employer salary(driver bus)

 +2. Risk
 +   - Apps system might be error in certain time.
  
 -# II. Synthesis
 ------
 -## 1. Requirements Definition
 -### a. Context Scenarios
 +   - Bluetooth connect.
  
 -1. Lisha did not have enough sleep last night. When she drives to class, Vaigo protects her from dozing off.
 -2. She increases the vibration just to make sure she will never sleep while driving.
 -3. During class, Vaigo alerts her when her eyelids are starting to get closer to each other due to boring lecture.
 -4. After she finished class, she checks Vaigo app to know how long she needs to take a nap before the next class.
 -5. Besides no one is waking her up from nap, her phone alarm will not even wake her up but Vaigo alerts her with high vibration enough to nudge her awake.
 -6. At home when she is working on her assignments, Vaigo will nudge her every 10 minits to make sure that she is focused.
 -7. At night, Vaigo tells her that she needs to sleep for about six hours just to have enough energy for the next day.
 -8. At the end of the day, she is so happy because Vaigo helped her to be more consistant and gives her more space to build more efficent routines.

 -- ### b. Requirements
 +3. Obstacles
 +   - Might have prohlem if alot of user on their bluetooh and can interupt other connection while connecting the tecnology.
  
 -  Describe necessary capabilities of the product (Define requirement)
 +   - Competing with other competitors.
  
 -  1. Functional and data needs
 +     ​
  
 -     (user's information, why user need this)
 -     
 -      Data requirements :
 -     
 -    - Personas' data needs are the objects and information that must be represented in the
 -      system. Using the semantics just described, it is often useful to think of data requirements
 -      as the objects and adjectives related to those objects. Common examples include
 -      accounts, people, addresses, documents, messages, songs, and images, as well as attributes
 -      of those, such as status, dates, size, creator, and subject.
 -     
 -     Functional requirements :
 -     
 -    - Functional needs are the operations or actions that need to be performed on the system's
 -      objects and that typically are translated into interface controls. These can be thought of
 -      as the product's actions. Functional needs also define places or containers where objects
 -      or information in the interface must be displayed. (These clearly are not actions in and of
 -      themselves but usually are suggested by actions.)
 -
 -    - design imperatives
 -    - user mental model
 -    - product vision
 -    - business requirements / Business requirements can include development timelines,
 -    budgetary and resource constraints, regulations and legal considerations, business models
 -    and pricing structures.
 -  
 -    - Gestures
 -    - Technology
 -

 -### b. Framework
 -Design overall structure of user experience
 -
 -1. Sketch
 -   1. if your project is a design product
 -      a. Your sketch must be a wireframe.
 -   2. if your project is a installation project
 -      a. Your sketch must be a installation sketch.
 -   3. Must have
 -      a. groupings and hierarchy
 -      b. Territories of each functional & design elements
 -      c. Arrangements of containers & components
 -2. Key path Scenario
 +4. Constraints 
 +   - Infrared reflectance oculography.
 +
 +   -  Vaigo alerts when the wearer has been idle for too long or when they’re starting to doze off by controlling the sensitivity of the algorithm.
 +
 +     ​
 +
 +5. Opportunities 
 +
 +   In spite of the obstacles we have, this project has strength from:
 +
 +   - Make much easier to use, and doesn’t require the high up-front capital investment that the other solutions do.
 +
 +   - Struggle to help the people who really need in easy way to make them alert .
 +
 +     ​
 +
 +### d. User observations
 +1. Users
 +
 +   **Driver**
 +
 +   These are the outcomes from seeing the real-time alertness status of each driver, measure safe driving habits such as scanning the road, checking side mirrors and taking rest breaks between long trips. Get notified for bad behavior such as driving while operating a phone, harsh acceleration and braking, and speeding.

 +
 +   ​
 +
 +   ​
 +
 +2. Behaviors
 +
 +   Based on our observations, we can categories drivers into five groups and later did a survey on drivers to determine their behavior when monitoring their perfomance :
 +
 +   - **Drowsy Drivers** -  Decrease the lack of drowsy among drivers.
 +
 +   - **Harsh Breaking** - Drivers that always break harshly while driving.
 +
 +   - **Speeding** - Drivers shows the positive behaviour while using vaigo.
 +
 +   - **Hard Cornes** - Drivers start to be more alert while in cornes part of road.
 +
 +   ​
 +
 +3. Attitudes
  
 +   How drivers care about them. Vaigo helps build trust and confidence between drivers and fleets, because using Vaigo shows you don’t just care about profits - you care about your drivers arriving home to their family safe and sound.

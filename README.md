1. Lisha did not have enough sleep last night. When she drives to class, Vaigo protects her from dozing off.
2. She increases the vibration just to make sure she will never sleep while driving.
3. During class, Vaigo alerts her when her eyelids are starting to get closer to each other due to boring lecture.
4. After she finished class, she checks Vaigo app to know how long she needs to take a nap before the next class.
5. Besides no one is waking her up from nap, her phone alarm will not even wake her up but Vaigo alerts her with high vibration enough to nudge her awake.
6. At home when she is working on her assignments, Vaigo will nudge her every 10 minits to make sure that she is focused.
7. At night, Vaigo tells her that she needs to sleep for about six hours just to have enough energy for the next day.
8. At the end of the day, she is so happy because Vaigo helped her to be more consistant and gives her more space to build more efficent routines.

- ### b. Requirements

  Describe necessary capabilities of the product (Define requirement)

  1. Functional and data needs

     (user's information, why user need this)
     
     - Data requirements :
     
      Personas' data needs are the objects and information that must be represented in the
      system. Using the semantics just described, it is often useful to think of data requirements
      as the objects and adjectives related to those objects. Common examples include
      accounts, people, addresses, documents, messages, songs, and images, as well as attributes
      of those, such as status, dates, size, creator, and subject.
     Functional requirements :
     
      - Functional needs are the operations or actions that need to be performed on the system's
      objects and that typically are translated into interface controls. These can be thought of
      as the product's actions. Functional needs also define places or containers where objects
      or information in the interface must be displayed. (These clearly are not actions in and of
      themselves but usually are suggested by actions.)

  - design imperatives
  - user mental model

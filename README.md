# **Vaigo** - *Headset Alertness.*

# I. Analysis

## 1. Research

### a. Scope

1. Objectives
   To create a Bluetooth headset to track driver drowsiness at the wheel.

2. How

   - It monitors the wearer's eyes and head motion for signs of drowsiness and stimulates them when they are dozing off.
   - A real-time dashboard allows management to track this information in real-time.
   
   ### b. Audit
1. Field (market) research

   In the past few years, many type of technology that are been use to alert people by not being sleepy while driving. Before this people usually drink a coffee or take anything that can prevent being sleepy while driving or working. But in this new era there are many technology that have been created to make people alert from being sleepy. There are some of the technology that have been created and most of the technology is slighly more simple and direct use by the user. Some of the user might have difficult time to use the technology without any feature so for any futher some research that have been collected based on people feels example in a boring lecture, cramming all night at the library, or working long hours at internships,Coffees and energy drinks were all somewhat effective in keeping people from dozing off, but the most reliable way to stay alert was having a buddy next to other that could watch others were losing people focus and nudge people when others started to doze off.
   
   2. Competitors / alternatives / replacement

   - **Driver Fatigue Monitor MR688** - http://www.care-drive.com/product/driver-fatigue-monitor-mr688/

     Pros

     - Provides early warning for driver fatigue and distraction driving status.
     - Detects sleep in opening eyes​.

     Cons

     - Sounds of the alarm can make people shock.

       ​

   - **Hush** - https://hush.technology/

     Pros

     - Notification Filter,
     - Personal Alarm.
     - Soothing Sounds.
     - Hush Tracker,

     Cons

     - Lack of software problem based on people review.

       ​

   - **Optalert** - http://www.optalert.com/

     Pros

     - Identify the first signs, reducing the risk of accident due to drowsiness.
     - Helps the driver proactively remove that self-debate early and eliminate the likelihood of a micro sleep.

     Cons

     - lack of apps system.
     
     - **Sleepwatcher XR** - http://www.exeros-technologies.com/products/driver-fatigue-management

     Pros

     - Assesses the drivers retina and eyelids for signs of fatigue.
     - non-contact, facial recognition infrared cameras that monitors human eyelid and retina status.
     
     Cons

     - shape is to big.
     

     ​

3. Relevant technologies

   - Bluetooth headset that monitors driver alertness at the wheel, by tracking eye and head motion. When it senses that the driver is drowsy, it can use a combination of audio alerts and vibrations to stimulate the driver and keep them safe at the wheel. Both individual drivers and professional drivers can use Vigo to stay safe at the wheel. For fleets, a real-time dashboard allows fleet managers to track this information and rearrange shifts and work schedules, to reduce the chances of a drowsiness-related accident.

   - Tracks patterns in the wearer’s blinks and their body's movement to quantify how alert they are in real time. The idea is simple - although the brain has a tendency to trick someone into thinking they’re mentally fit enough to keep pushing on with daily business, the body can’t hide when it’s tired. With an infrared sensor, an accelerometer, and a clever algorithm.

### c. Stakeholder Interviews
      1. Project vision

   - We intend to provide our clients can be alerted when they are starting to get drowsy, and given gentle “nudges” to help them stay        alert.

-----
      2. Risk
   - Apps system might be error in certain time.

   - Bluetooth connect.

-----
      3. Obstacles
   - Might have prohlem if alot of user on their bluetooh and can interupt other connection while connecting the tecnology.

   - Competing with other competitors.

-----
      4. Constraints 
   - Infrared reflectance oculography.

   -  Vaigo alerts when the wearer has been idle for too long or when they’re starting to doze off by controlling the sensitivity of the algorithm.

-----
      5. Opportunities 
   - In spite of the obstacles we have, this project has strength from:

   - Make much easier to use, and doesn’t require the high up-front capital investment that the other solutions do.

   - Struggle to help the people who really need in easy way to make them alert .

### d. User observations
-----
1. Users

   **Driver**

   These are the outcomes from seeing the real-time alertness status of each driver, measure safe driving habits such as scanning the road, checking side mirrors and taking rest breaks between long trips. Get notified for bad behavior such as driving while operating a phone, harsh acceleration and braking, and speeding.

-----
 2. Behaviors

   - Based on our observations, we can categories drivers into five groups and later did a survey on drivers to determine their behavior when monitoring their perfomance :

   - **Drowsy Drivers** -  Decrease the lack of drowsy among drivers.

   - **Harsh Breaking** - Drivers that always break harshly while driving.

   - **Speeding** - Drivers shows the positive behaviour while using vaigo.

   - **Hard Cornes** - Drivers start to be more alert while in cornes part of road.

3. Attitudes
   - How drivers care about them. Vaigo helps build trust and confidence between drivers and fleets, because using Vaigo shows you don’t just care about profits - you care about your drivers arriving home to their family safe and sound.

4. Motivations
   - Road driver can drive safety and also the passenger. Can increase awareness and reduce road accident.
   - Road driver can drive safety and also the passenger. Can increase awareness and reduce road accident.
  
  
5. Environments.
      - Road
      - Around Petaling state.
  
6. Tools
   - no exact device before this to awake driver
   - vaigo device is the right tool to use to awake sleepy driver.
